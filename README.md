| [scrape.py](https://github.com/AarchiveSoft/ArtNrToID.git/blob/master/scrape.py) | The `scrape.py` file within the ArtNrToID repository houses the Gambio ID Converter Application, a user-friendly GUI tool developed using PyQt6. This tool enables users to convert article numbers into Gambio IDs by selecting product categories, excluding specific articles, and viewing the conversion results. It interacts with a SQLite database for data storage and retrieval and employs Selenium for web scraping to extract product information from a designated website.**Key Features:**-Intuitive interface for brand and category selection.-Option to exclude specific articles from the conversion process.-Real-time progress updates during web scraping.-Results can be conveniently copied to the clipboard.This applications main class, `GUI`, orchestrates the GUI components, such as brand and category dropdowns, exclusion input fields, and conversion/copy result buttons, ensuring a seamless user experience. |
